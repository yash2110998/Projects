Daily Temperature Time Series Forecasting
Overview
This project provides a comprehensive workflow for forecasting daily minimum temperatures using time series analysis techniques. The main goal is to help users predict future temperature values based on historical data, which is essential for planning in sectors like agriculture, energy management, and climate research.

Problem Statement
Accurate temperature forecasting is a challenging task due to the complex and seasonal nature of weather data. Many traditional methods struggle to capture patterns and trends over time, leading to unreliable predictions. This project addresses this problem by implementing statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze, model, and forecast daily temperatures.

What This Project Does
Data Loading & Cleaning: Imports historical daily minimum temperature data, handles missing values, and ensures the data is ready for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizes temperature trends and checks for stationarity and seasonality within the dataset.
Time Series Decomposition: Breaks down the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components for better understanding.
Model Building (ARIMA): Utilizes the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model, a widely used forecasting approach for time series data.
Model Evaluation: Assesses model performance with validation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Forecasting: Generates temperature forecasts for future periods and visualizes both actual and predicted values.
